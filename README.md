# PrisonerSkills-UI

### Author

### Purpose
This is a static product landing page for the Oversite app. The page was built by me during Lambda School's build week from 27 May to 31 May 2019. The app allows prison management to broadcast the skill of inmates to potential employers, so that the inamtes may use their skills to make a wage and become more employable after prison.

### Role
As a UI developer, I was tasked with building a multi-page marketing website that matches the theme chosen by our groups UX's designer, and provide the users with details about the Oversite app. 

### Features
This page was built using HTML and vanilla JS and styled with CSS and LESS. It is responsive and include breakpoints for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
